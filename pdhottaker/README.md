# pdhottaker
A discord bot that randomly generates dubious claims on PD balance.

Additions to strings.json are welcome! Open a pull request or send them to my DMs as JSON arrays. [This website](https://wtools.io/convert-list-to-json-array) can help a lot.

## Invite
You can invite this bot to your server using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=968217115146485842&permissions=536873984&scope=bot). Be warned that it might not always be available as it is hosted on my PC.

**Make sure to restrict the bot's role to only see the channels it should be allowed to use!**

Don't forget to run !opinionsetup in every channel you want the bot to run in.

## Usage
Send !opinion in any channel the bot has access to.
